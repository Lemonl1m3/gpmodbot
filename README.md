# gpmodbot
Bot that streams from Google Play Music to Discord servers

# imports
<a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">discord.py</a> - a Python library with audio-streaming capabilities built on the unofficial official Discord API<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi">gmusicapi</a> - an unofficial Python API for Google Play Music<br/>

# goals
Bring the functionality of a cloud-based online music streaming service to an accessible bot for Discord servers. Allow users to send commands (![a-z]) to perform searches, play music, save queues, modify playlists, and more. If discord.py does add support for receiving audio, one goal will be to allow users to perform searches by voice, another for the music to respond to users talking in the channel and automatically drop the volume of the streaming content to allow for easier communication.
