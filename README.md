# gpmodbot
Bot that streams from Google Play Music to Discord servers

# imports
<a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">discord.py</a> - a Python library with audio-streaming capabilities built on the unofficial official Discord API<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi">gmusicapi</a> - an unofficial Python API for Google Play Music<br/>

# goals
Bring the functionality of a cloud-based online music streaming service to an accessible bot for Discord servers. Allow users to send commands (![a-z]) to perform searches, play music, save queues, modify playlists, and more. If discord.py does add support for receiving audio, one goal will be to allow users to perform searches by voice, another for the music to respond to users talking in the channel and automatically drop the volume of the streaming content to allow for easier communication.

So I've had the wireframe for this particular design kicking around for some time, but with all
the other interesting (and in some cases, semi-secret) projects I've been working on it took me
a little while to get to actually designing and coding it. Fortunately, things have eased up
enough for me to finaly get around to it, so I'm happy to introduce Hyperspace: a fun, blocky,
one-page design with a lot of color, a bit of animation, and an additional "generic" page template
(because hey, even one-page sites usually need an interior page or two). Hope you dig it :)
